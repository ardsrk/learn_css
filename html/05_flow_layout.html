    <h1>Flow Layout</h1>
    <article>
      <p>
      <strong>Block elements</strong> take up the full horizontal space. Notice the heading above. The heading occupies all the available
      width even though it has only 11 characters. Most of the elements like div, h1, p, form, and so forth are block
      elements. They stack along the vertical direction.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Inline elements</strong> take up only space that is required. <span class="red">This span in red is inline.</span> Inline
      elements like em, strong, span, and so forth grow in the horizontal direction and wrap to the next line if current line
      cannot fit the element.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Inline block elements</strong> act as block elements internally, while externally rendered as inline. The button
      tag and select tag are inline-block elements by default. The button <button>do not press</button> has a width and a height
      but does not occupy the whole horizontal space. Also notice that, inline-block elements <em>do not line-wrap</em>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The <strong>display</strong> property can be set to override the default behaviour. See the <em>div</em> boxes acting as
      inline elements below. Also notice that the left and right margins of the <strong>boxes do not collapse</strong> and 
      the top and bottom margins are <strong>ignored</strong>. It is not recommended to set border, margin, and
      padding properties on inline elements as the behavior is not well-defined.
      </p>

      <div class="box">BOX1</div><div class="box">BOX2</div><div class="box">BOX3</div><div class="box">BOX4</div>
      <p>
      Tip: Change the value of display property of the boxes to <em>inline-block</em> and observe what happens.
