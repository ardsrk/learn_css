    <h1>Box Model</h1>
    <article>
      <p>Assume we received a package from Amazon. According to the Box Model we would first remove the margin, then
      remove the border, then the padding, and finally take the content.</p>
      <div class="content_box">
        Content Box
      </div>

      <div class="border_box">
        Border Box
      </div>
      <p> Both the boxes have width and height of 100 pixels. But the value of <strong>box-sizing</strong> property decides
      the actual space available for the content.</p>

      <p>The box having <em>content-box</em> as the value for "box-sizing" gets to use 100 pixels of width and height
       for its content. </p>
      <p>While the box having <em>border-box</em> as the value for "box-sizing" gets to use only 30 pixels of width and height
      for its content. </p>
      <h2>Note</h2>
      <p> Open the dev tools of your browser and observe that the text in the second box overflows the content and spills
      over to the padding area.</p>

      <p>Also notice that text starts filling the content area starting from the top-left position.</p>
