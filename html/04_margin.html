    <h1>Margin</h1>
    <article>
      <h2>Margin Collapse</h2>
      Margins are the outermost element of a box. Positive margin values are intuitive, however, negative margins,
      and margin collapse are trickier and need explanation.

      <div class="box1">
        BOX1
      </div>

      <div class="box2">
        BOX2
      </div>
      <p>
      BOX1 has a bottom margin of 10px and BOX2 has a top margin of 20px. Therefore, we would expect them to be 30 pixels
      apart. However, the bottom margin of BOX1 collapses with the top margin of BOX2 and they end up 20 pixels apart.
      </p>
      <div class="box3">
        <div class="box4">
          BOX4
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
      Now, the top margins of <em>.box3</em> and <em>.box4</em> collapse and the space between BOX4 and the paragraph
      above it is only 30px instead of the expected 40px. Margins of parent and child elements collapse only when the
      parent does not have border, padding, and content.
      </p>
      <h2>Negative margins</h2>
      <p>
      Negative margins pull the adjacent elements closer.
      </p>
      <div class="box5">
        BOX5
      </div>
      <div class="box6">
        BOX6
      </div>
      <p>
      The last box has a margin of 30px while the box above has a margin of -40px. Since both the boxes do not have
      padding and border, their contents end up getting overlapped.
      </p>
      <h2>Note</h2>
      <p>
      Margin collapse and negative margins are shown here in the vertical direction ( top and bottom ). It is worth
      noting that collapse and negative margins behave similarly in the horizontal direction ( left and right ).
